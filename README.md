## Notification Server
The provided code sets up a Node.js application for handling and processing notifications through different channels such as push, SMS, and email. Here is a summary of the key components and functionalities:

1. **Dependencies**:
   - The code requires the following dependencies, which can be installed using npm:
     - `express`: For building the web application.
     - `bull`: A Redis-backed queue package for handling job processing.
     - `body-parser`: Middleware for parsing the incoming request bodies.

2. **Queues and Workers**:
   - Separate queues are created for each notification channel (push, SMS, email).
   - Workers are defined for each queue to process the incoming jobs and handle the notification logic.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling is implemented for each type of notification worker to log and handle any job processing failures.

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - The application exposes a POST endpoint `/sendNotification` to enqueue notifications for the user's preferred channels.

5. **User Preferences and Notification Enqueuing**:
   - The code retrieves user preferences and enqueues notifications for each channel based on the user's preferences.

6. **Notification Sending**:
   - Placeholder functions are defined for sending push notifications, SMS, and emails.

7. **Server Setup**:
   - The application listens on a specified port for incoming HTTP requests.

For running the code, ensure that the required dependencies are installed and the necessary logic for sending actual notifications (e.g., push, SMS, email) is implemented within the respective functions.
